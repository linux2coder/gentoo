Iam using a open-rc based gnome desktop-evironment
emerge -a sys-power/acpid # required for power saving capability and hardware switch configurations
nano -w /etc/acpi/default.sh
edit code looking like this:
                  lid)
				                if [ `cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID0/state | awk '{print $2}'` = "closed" ] 
                                       then 
                                                loginctl suspend # loginctl is used in open-rc ,replace it with systemctl suspend for systemd
				                fi 
				                ;;
